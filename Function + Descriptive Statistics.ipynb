Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030.                                                                        </td><td>Martha's Vineyard                   </td><td>96</td><td>235</td><td>California        </td><td>Napa Valley              </td><td>Napa             </td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Heitz                  </td></tr>\n",

Drink through 2023.                                                                                                             </td><td>Carodorum Selección Especial Reserva</td><td>96</td><td>110</td><td>Northern Spain    </td><td>Toro                     </td><td>                 </td><td>Tinta de Toro     </td><td>Bodega Carmen Rodríguez</td></tr>\n",

The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.      | Demi-Sec                      | 91 | 30 | Champagne          | Champagne                  | <!----> | Champagne Blend       | Jacquart                |\n",

Really rich and complex, with supple lime flavors offsetting the earthy impression. Very dry, with an overall excellent palate impression. Should continue to age and grow finer.                                                                                                               \n",
       "150923 Made by 30-ish Roberta Borghese high above Manzano, which also happens to be the chair manufacturing capital of Italy, this is a perfect example of how good Tocai can be. The aromas are honey and grapefruit-orange. After an intro of crisp acidity, the same flavors appear and persist on the medium body. Match this one with a good seafood risotto.                                                                                    \n",
       "150924 Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters.     \n",
       "150925 Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements. There are mature notes to the apple, toast and pepper flavors, good backbone, and the texture is just lovely. This well-developed example still has youthful elements, and closes with a grapefruit-mineral finish that is both relaxed and complex.                                                                  \n",
       "150926 Many people feel Fiano represents southern Italy’s most promising white grape, and after tasting this rendition, who can argue? The flavor package is pineapple, citrus and wet stones. The structure and mouthfeel are what many Italian whites strive for but never reach. An elegant wine.                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "150927 Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeral—almost too light—but there’s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "150928 This classic example comes from a cru vineyard called Terre di Dora, which is named after the Mastroberardinos’ mother. They should all be proud of this one. Wet stones, apples, peaches and pears start it off. On the palate, the structure and mouthfeel are nearly perfect. The finish features the butterscotch tones of malolactic fermentation. A wonderful example of what Fiano di Avellino can be.                                  \n",
       "150929 A perfect salmon shade, with scents of peaches, cherries and toast. It hits the palate with big, ripe, fresh fruit: crisp apples, peaches, cherries and citrus.

       "150930 More Pinot Grigios should taste like this. A rich pear-like nose is followed by crisp acidity, a medium body and a viscous mouthfeel.

This handsome modern-style Rioja finishes long and tangy, with moderate tannins.                                                                                                                \n",
       "149611 A sadly unbalanced wine from a company that has a name for tawny Ports. With its sweetness, marred by a touch of reduction (too long in old barrels?), it has a curious sweet/sour aftertaste.                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "149620 This is more like an Italian bitters than a Port, with its roasted coffee aromas, and bitter flavors.
